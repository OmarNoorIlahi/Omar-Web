## Overview

This project is part of Task One under the Web & Applications Programming track, submitted to Smart Methods Company for the 2025 Summer Internship. It showcases a personal web page featuring my information and a brief introduction. The page includes dynamic elements and vibrant colors.

## Methods

The primary development environment for this project is **Visual Studio**, which provides the necessary tools. The website is built using three programming languages: **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

### HTML

HTML is utilized to create the structure of the website. The title of the page is "OMAR NOOR ILAHI." Since this is a single-page website, it consists of one head, body, and section, displaying welcome messages and information about me.

> **Note:** The HTML code is available as a separate file in the repository.

### CSS

CSS is used to style the page, including sizes, fonts, colors, backgrounds, and animations. The color scheme is inspired by my favorite football team, FC Barcelona. The text is centered and animated with a fade-in effect.

> **Note:** The CSS code is available as a separate file in the repository.

### JavaScript

JavaScript adds dynamic features to the page. For example, the name is displayed using a typing animation. Additionally, the button is interactive, featuring hover and click effects.

> **Note:** The JavaScript code is available as a separate file in the repository.

## Features

- Letter-by-letter typing animation for the name.
- Inspired by FC Barcelona's color theme (deep red, deep blue, yellow accent).
- An interactive button that changes to green and displays another message upon clicking.

## Conclusion

This website is just the beginning of a larger project. Future updates will include sections for internships, projects, and skills, ultimately serving as my personal portfolio. Stay tuned for more!
