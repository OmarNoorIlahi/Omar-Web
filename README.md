## Overview

This is task one under the Webs & Applications Programming track, submitted to Smart Methods company for 2025 Summer Internship. This task depicts a personal web page, containing some personal information and a brief introduction about myself. It also integrates some dynamic features with powerful colors. 

## Methods

First of all, the main environment is **Visual Studio** as this program provides the required tools for the task. Three different programming languages are utilized to build the website, including  **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

### HTML

The HTML is used to build the structure of the website. The title of the page is my name “OMAR NOOR ILAHI”. The website is only one page, so it consists of only one head, body, and section, displaying welcome messages and who is Omar. 

> **Note:** The HTML code is available as a separate file in the repository.

### CSS

The CSS is utilized to add style on the page, including sizes, fonts, colors, background, and animation. The color scheme is inspired by my favorite football team, FC Barcelona. Additionally, the text is aligned and sized exactly in the middle of the page, and it is animated with a fade-in effect. 

> **Note:** The CSS code is available as a separate file in the repository.

### JavaScript

Java Script adds some dynamics to the page. For illustration, the name sentence is displayed using a typing animation. Furthermore, the button is interactive as it is pressable with hover and click effects. 

> **Note:** The JavaScript code is available as a separate file in the repository.

## Features

- Letter-by-letter typing animation for the name.
- Inspired by FC Barcelona's color theme (deep red, deep blue, yellow accent).
- An interactive button that changes to green and displays another message upon clicking.

## Conclusion

Finally, this website is only the first step into something bigger soon. More sections such as internships, projects and skills will be added to complete the big picture of the page. This website will constitute my personal portfolio in the future, so wait for me!
